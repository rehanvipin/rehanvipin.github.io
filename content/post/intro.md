Recreating my homepage on the internet with Hugo.
<!--more-->

### History
I used to have a static portfolio website. It was hard to configure.
Written in Jekyll, it was abstracted a bit too much for my liking.

I would like to blame that for not making the portfolio, but that's only
partly true. I never truly spent time on it or had any goals for my site.  
All that is changing, I shall make sure. From now on, I plan to completely focus on whatever I pick up. Being careful in that process.
Too often do people start projects without plans, this increases the probability of dropping it later on. Atleast for me.

### Decisions taken
A static site generator means fast load and develop times. With content being given more importance. Hugo offers a good balance between customizability and abstraction. I look forward to utilizing it fully.

Hosting on Github pages shall be going on for a while. GitHub's loading times are fast and management is extremely convenient. Of course, it's free too.

### What's new
I've decided that I shall give this portfolio my highest priority. This means that new projects are being kept on the back-burner for now.
If this becomes a habit I hope it leads to me making good things that other people want to use.
Here's the plan for this website:
* Make all columns - Homepage, projects, ambitions, about(work experience).
* Add content to them. Iteratively.
* Choose a more suitable theme/ Modify this one.
* Buy a domain name.
* Write blog articles.
* Move on to making projects, but update progress here. GitHub is too public.

**Time to publish this now!!**

Thanks a lot to my family, friends and so many good people on the internet without whose motivation and advices I would not be actively developing a portfolio.
