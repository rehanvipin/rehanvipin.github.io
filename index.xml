      <description>Create a portfolio site (minimum expenditure &amp;amp; work) I created my portfolio site with Hugo, again!
This time, with a plan and adequate free time, I was able to get it to a publishable version 1.0. There is almost no front-end development involved and zero back-end work too(I did work on the backend engine of verless, another static site generator, so not technically zero xD).
I will document the process soon, but here are the main steps:</description>

      <description>A few things I believe :  Optimal states are a balance of options. Applies to all points below too First make things work, then make them perfect over iterations Work for things close to you before changing the world Careful planning in the start can save a lot of time later on Miscommunication is a major problem that we should work more on Success is determined by a mix of effort you put in and the opportunities you have  </description>

      <description>What will you see here? There are many random things I want to write down and let the world know.
Like this blog article, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t have much reason to exist.
But hey, this is my webiste. I hope to loosen the constraints I keep on other platforms.
A few general themes can be expected though.
 Software development. Will mostly be a major part of my career so only fitting.</description>

      <description>Some projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on :) Favourites for each category. Not part of work. Check resume for more serious ones and github for other less serious ones :P.
Mini project collection (Soul-sapphire) Made during the first month of the 100DaysOfCode challenge to learn how to use Go in real applications.
All project ideas were taken from Gophercises, but implemented by me without any tutorial or guidance ;)
Technologies and language features I learnt/used</description>

      <description>About Me  I&amp;rsquo;m a Third-year student at PES University studying Computer Science Engineering. Domains I&amp;rsquo;m majorly interested in -
 Cryptography Hacking around systems and distributed systems Quantum mechanics and quantum information science Algorithms (Discrete optimization, Game theory) Deep learning (reinforcement learning)  I love hacking systems (not cracking them!) to learn how they work. I like Developer communities and collaborative learning too. My hobbies include Cycling, Drawing and reading Mystery books :)</description>
