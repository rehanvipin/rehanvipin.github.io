      <description>What will you see here? There are many random things I want to write down and let the world know.
Like this blog article, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t have much reason to exist.

A few general themes can be expected though.
 Software development. Will mostly be a major part of my career so only fitting.</description>

      <description>About Me  I&amp;rsquo;m a Junior at PES University studying Computer Science Engineering. Domains I&amp;rsquo;m majorly interested in -
 Cryptography Hacking around systems and distributed systems Quantum mechanics and quantum information science Algorithms (Discrete optimization, Game theory) Deep learning (reinforcement learning)  I love hacking systems (not cracking them!) to learn how they work. I like Developer communities and collaborative learning too. My hobbies include Cycling, Drawing and reading Mystery books :)</description>
